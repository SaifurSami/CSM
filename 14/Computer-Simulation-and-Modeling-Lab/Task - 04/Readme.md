# Problem : Simulation of a Chemical Reactor

# Problem Statement:

- **There are two substances A and B. They produce third substance C. The rate of formation of C is proportional to presence of A and B. Write a program to simulate how much of C has been produced as a function of time, âˆ†t = 0.1.**
- **Assume that a = 100g, b = 50g and c = 0g are quantities of A, B and C at time t = 0. Rate constants are also given as follows k1 = 0.008 and k2 = 0.002.**
